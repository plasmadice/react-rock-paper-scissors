#### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

##### This project is live [here](https://plasmadice.github.io/react-rock-paper-scissors).


###### How to Play

The game has 5 rounds. The first to reach 5 rounds wins.

This is the second project that I have created with React. This one is to replace the original Rock-Paper-Scissors app.

In this session I learned how to effectively section apps by creating components and how to make components work together through props.

It's unlikely that I will touch up on this project again.
